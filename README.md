# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** repository! This repository contains resources, tutorials, and projects related to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).

## 🚀 About
Machine learning and deep learning are subfields of artificial intelligence that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Focuses on algorithms that can learn patterns from data and make predictions.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to extract higher-level features from raw data.
